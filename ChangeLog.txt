	->Implementend game loop and made necassary changes to affected classes.
		@Description: game loop calls for each element in the entity list the method update(ticktime)
		
	->Implemented new canvas update based on mapChanges. Created new helper class for this purpose.
		!DANGER!: For this to work: use gameInstance.addElementToMap() and gameInstance.removeElementfromMap()
		-> it automatically adds them to the corresponing list of the helper class
		-> Don't use map.getMapElements.add()!!
	
	->Created new helper class for the calculation of the next snake step
		@Description: stores the key input into a list of SnakeHeadDirection enums. 
		On Snake do step. removes the current snake direction and the opposite.
		-> if size = 1 the content has to be the new direction
		-> else -> the previous direction will be kept.
		-> after doing a step the snake clears the list for further inputs
		-> maybe we should synchronisize the methods for this feature

	->NEW BUG! Found no solution so far:
		@Description: The game loop iterates through the stack of game entities.
		If an entities lifetime reaches zero it tries to delete itself from the game entities list.
		Java does not allow this. I tried to solve this via a Iterator, no success.
		Maybe starting adding this command to the commandthread (like in addPointsToHighscore) could fix this problem. 
	
	->I apologize for missing comments. They will follow ASAP

	->I suggest adding to features in this changelog on top, so that the most recentchange is visible at opening the document.
